### License clarification regarding non-commercial use:
The non-commercial aspect of this license is for cases where A4T Cutter is the product, not the use of A4T Cutter to create products.<br/>
I.e. If you wish to sell A4T Cutter as a product, you would need to seek a commercial license before doing so. </br>
It is NOT intended to prevent the use of A4T Cutter in a printer that you use to provide commercial services. If you want to run A4T Cutter as a toolhead for your print farm printers, go right ahead.
